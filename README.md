Differences between HTML and JSX
- In JSX you have to return a single parent element or it won't compile.
- In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly; in curly braces whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
- All tags can self-close in JSX whereas in HTML only specific tags such as <img/>, <br/>, <hr/> and <input/>.
- The keywords 'class' and 'for' in HTML are reserved in JSX and replaced with 'className' and 'HTMLFor'.

Why can't browsers read JSX?
- Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it and so it needs a transpiler like babel to transform JSX into native Javascript and HTML which the browser can understand.
